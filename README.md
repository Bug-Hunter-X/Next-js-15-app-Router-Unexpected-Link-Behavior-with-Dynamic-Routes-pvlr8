# Next.js 15 App Router Link Issue with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with `next/link` when used within a Next.js 15 app router with dynamic routes. The link sometimes fails to navigate correctly or renders incorrectly.

## Bug

The provided code shows a basic `next/link` component that, under certain circumstances, fails to function as expected in a Next.js 15 app directory environment. This is more likely to happen with dynamic routes.

## Solution

The issue might be related to how the app router handles client-side navigation or potential conflicts with other libraries. The solution involves verifying the route definitions, ensuring no conflicting route matches, and reviewing the structure of dynamic routes.  In some cases, using a simple `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute may work around this issue. However, for the advantages of `next/link` (prefetching, etc.), further debugging might be needed with more details of how the app is set up.
